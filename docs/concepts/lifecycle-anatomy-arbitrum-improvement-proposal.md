An <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-improvement-proposal">Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP)</a> is a proposal submitted by a member of the Arbitrum DAO that proposes a change to the Arbitrum ecosystem. There are two types of AIPs: <a data-quicklook-from="constitutional-proposal">Constitutional</a> and <a data-quicklook-from="non-constitutional-proposal">non-Constitutional</a>:

- **Constitutional AIPs** are those that modify the text or procedures of the Constitution or AIP-1, install or modify software on any chain, or take any action that requires "chain owner" permission on any chain. 
- **Non-Constitutional AIPs** are all other AIPs, such as those that request funds/grants or provide general guidelines or information to the community.

In this conceptual overview, we'll evaluate the lifecycle and anatomy of both types.







### Conclusion

This conceptual overview presents a reader-friendly overview of the process detailed within the Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO. The process starts with an informal temperature check, where the AIP is suggested on the Arbitrum DAO governance forum and discussed/debated for 1 week. If the AIP passes the temperature check, it moves on to the next phase, which is the formal AIP and call for voting. In this phase, the AIP is submitted via governance contracts on Arbitrum One via Tally's user interface. After 3 days, a voter distribution snapshot is taken and the voting period begins.

Each AIP must be labeled as Constitutional or non-Constitutional, and must also clearly specify which Arbitrum DAO-governed chain(s) it will affect. As a recommended guideline, an AIP should include an abstract, motivation, rationale, key terms, specifications, steps to implement, timeline, and overall cost.

After the voting period, the AIP passes if more Votable Tokens have casted votes "in favor" than have casted votes "against", and a threshold of at least 5% of all Votable Tokens have casted votes "in favor" for Constitutional AIPs or 3% of all Votable Tokens have casted votes "in favor" for Non-Constitutional AIPs. If the AIP passes, it moves on to Phases 4 through 7, which include L2 and L1 waiting periods, and final implementation.

Overall, the AIP process is designed to ensure that proposed changes align with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values, and that the community has the opportunity to discuss, debate, and vote on proposed changes. The process typically takes 34 days for a Constitutional AIP or 21 days for a Non-Constitutional AIP, but may take longer if specified by the AIP.
