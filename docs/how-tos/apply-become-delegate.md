 1. Editing for technical precision and completeness (we are here - once an SME signs off on this "core truth", we can edit for structure / clarity / brevity / consistency - see the gov docs page for details: https://www.notion.so/arbitrum/Governance-docs-46934705e74b4ae096b2fcdb3755aa40)
   - This unblocks other types of editing 
   - Other editorial feedback is welcome of course, but the most important feedback at this point is editing for technical precision and completeness. SME-signoff signals that from the SME's perspective, it looks truthful and complete.
 2. Other things that we need to do (can parallelize, but confidence will increase as we have SME signoffs on technical accuracy and completeness)
   - Editing for structure / clarity / brevity / consistency / metadata
      - Examples of things in this step: logical and patterned sections, consistent formatting, consistency across the corpus, consistent usage of proper nouns, thoughtful SEO-friendly descriptions
   - link to docs (wherever the reader is likely to want to read supporting docs, link to them inline, and wire up "next" and "prev" links at the bottom of each page)
   - wire up quicklooks (wrap first-mentions of key terms in <a data-quicklook-from> tags, and ensure the definitions are in the glossary, signed off by SMEs, and rendered using Glossary CMS)
   - ask questions and add to FAQ (wherever a given reader persona - user, dev, token-holder, delegate, proposal submitter, council member, etc) is likely to have questions, add a question to the FAQ and render it within a FAQs section by using the FAQ CMS publishing pipeline)
   - continue refining term definitions (periodically review the Glossary CMS to drive consistency and clarity through iteration, ideally with continuous peer review and support)
   - reference specific sections of the constitution from each statement, whenever possible (via markdown-not-html-footnotes that connect the statement to the constitution while disarming various forms of skepticism, confusion, and risk)
   - invite peers to help with the long-tail of todos, & peer-review content experience and comment on friction points (right now we determine gov, once the switch is flipped, it will determine us, feels important to get this right for "the spirit of our work" and risk / optics reasons)
   - confidently shift our focus to fun non-gov things together!

### Background

Delegates are members of the <a data-quicklook-from='arbitrum-dao'>Arbitrum DAO</a> that have the ability to vote on <a data-quicklook-from='governance-proposal'>proposals</a>.

Once the <a data-quicklook-from='arb'>$ARB</a> token is circulating, anybody can become a delegate by having a token holder delegate votes to them (see ["How to delegate your voting power"](./select-delegate-voting-power.md)).

When users are initially claiming their tokens from the <a data-quicklook-from='airdrop'>airdop</a>, they will be given the option to delegate their votes to any parties in a list of candidate "early delegates." In this how-to, you'll learn how to apply to become one of these early delegates!


### Apply to be an early delegate
Before applying to become a delegate, it's important to understand the responsibilities and requirements of the role. Delegates are expected to actively participate in the decision-making process and to act in the best interests of the network. They should also be familiar with The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO and other relevant governance documents.

To apply to become an early delegate for the Arbitrum DAO, complete the following steps:

 1. Review the [Constitution](../dao-constitution.md) and other relevant governance documents to ensure that you understand the role of a delegate and the responsibilities and requirements associated with it.
 2. Review the [comprehension check](../comprehension-check.md) to self-assess your understanding of the protocol.
 3. [Build a strong delegate platform](build-strong-delegate-platform.md). This includes creating a website or social media account that outlines your qualifications, experience, and vision for the Arbitrum DAO. It's also important to demonstrate your understanding of the protocol and the issues facing the network.
 4. Submit an application to the Arbitrum DAO's governance forum  following the structure of the template posted in the [this thread](https://forum.arbitrum.io/t/delegation-submission-template/16) (TODO: ensure link is fr correct).
 5. Once your application is received, it will be reviewed by Arbitrum team, and if accepted, you'll become a delegate.

Remember, regardless of this initial application process, any party can become a delegate at any time by simply having votes delegated to them; the community may still wish to hold additional "elections" similar to this application process in the future.


Becoming a delegate is a significant responsibility and should not be taken lightly. Delegates should have aa solid foundational technical understanding of the Arbitrum protocol, a sense of the Ethereum ecosystem at large, and a desire to engage with the Arbitrum community.
